      "Among other renewable energy sources (e.g., wind, tides, geothermal heat), photovoltaic (PV) solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energies available all over the world (International Energy Agency, 2018). However, solar energy generation is affected by geographical location, and thus accurately predicting the potential PV power available at candidate sites is critical to the success of solar PV projects (International Finance Corporation (IFC), 2019). For example, estimated power generation commonly serves as a crucial input to assess the feasibility of PV projects and select a suitable installation location for PV panels (Liu et al., 2017). Long-term forecasting of PV power is also important in balancing electricity supply and demand, improving energy performance (Lin and Pai, 2016), and financial planning (International Finance Corporation, 2019). However, estimating the potential for solar PV power generation is challenging because of topographical and meteorological conditions at the site, which differ from region to region and vary over time (Das et al., 2018). The estimated amount of solar energy depends on the aspect and slope of the specific location, which can be extracted from terrain datasets (Gastli and Charabi, 2010). The amount of power generated is also strongly affected by weather conditions because the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth varies by season and even within days. Hontoria et al. (2019) pointed out that the use of solar irradiation data at high temporal resolutions (e.g., less than 1 h) is important when designing PV systems for smart grids. The combined uncertainties of topographical and meteorological conditions lead to difficulties in estimating the potential of power generation at new candidate sites. In addition, it was pointed out that the potential energy generation was not often verified with the actual PV power data in the previous studies (Liu et al., 2017; Al-Soud and Hrayshat, 2009).\n"
