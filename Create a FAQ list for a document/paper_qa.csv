Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction2,"To address those issues, machine learningebased approaches have been adopted (Table 1) to model the complex patterns in massive datasets (e.g., weather conditions) and predict energy potential through computational experimentation (Kalogirou, 2001).

For instance, the topographical conditions, which can be extracted from terrain datasets, determine the spatial variations of solar irradiation ( Súri et al., 2005).

Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction4,"Although short-term forecasting (e.g., 1 h or one day ahead) is suitable for balancing variations between power supply and demand, long-term forecasting is needed to assess the economic feasibility (e.g., annual revenues) of new PV plants when investigating potential PV sites (Antonanzas et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2002).
