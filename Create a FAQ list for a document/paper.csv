Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction1,"Among other renewable energy sources (e.g., wind, tides, geothermal heat), photovoltaic (PV) solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energies available all over the world (International Energy Agency, 2018). However, solar energy generation is affected by geographical location, and thus accurately predicting the potential PV power available at candidate sites is critical to the success of solar PV projects (International Finance Corporation (IFC), 2019). For example, estimated power generation commonly serves as a crucial input to assess the feasibility of PV projects and select a suitable installation location for PV panels (Liu et al., 2017). Long-term forecasting of PV power is also important in balancing electricity supply and demand, improving energy performance (Lin and Pai, 2016), and financial planning (International Finance Corporation, 2019). However, estimating the potential for solar PV power generation is challenging because of topographical and meteorological conditions at the site, which differ from region to region and vary over time (Das et al., 2018). The estimated amount of solar energy depends on the aspect and slope of the specific location, which can be extracted from terrain datasets (Gastli and Charabi, 2010). The amount of power generated is also strongly affected by weather conditions because the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth varies by season and even within days. Hontoria et al. (2019) pointed out that the use of solar irradiation data at high temporal resolutions (e.g., less than 1 h) is important when designing PV systems for smart grids. The combined uncertainties of topographical and meteorological conditions lead to difficulties in estimating the potential of power generation at new candidate sites. In addition, it was pointed out that the potential energy generation was not often verified with the actual PV power data in the previous studies (Liu et al., 2017; Al-Soud and Hrayshat, 2009)."
Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction2,"To address those issues, machine learningebased approaches have been adopted (Table 1) to model the complex patterns in massive datasets (e.g., weather conditions) and predict energy potential through computational experimentation (Kalogirou, 2001). Table 1 summarizes the approaches presented in prior studies, which can be classified as direct and indirect forecasting models (Das et al., 2018). The direct methods (Chen et al., 2011; Izgi et al., 2012; Pedro and Coimbra, 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Wolff et al., 2016; Gensler et al., 2016; Abdel-Nasser and Mahmoud, 2017; Han et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019) estimate the amount of PV power generation by directly learning the complex relationships among the variables (e.g., solar irradiation, temperature) and the power output (Antonanzas et al., 2016). Previously reported direct models mostly focus on operation planning for a specific PV system by forecasting the potential electric power in the short term. In contrast, the indirect methods (Yeo and Yee, 2014; Mellit and Pavan, 2010; Yona et al., 2008; Almonacid et al., 2014) begin by predicting solar irradiation and use a numerical or analytical conversion model with those predictions to estimate PV power generation. The indirect models can be site-specific (e.g., one target plant in Table 1) if the technical details of the PV equipment are not fully known (Antonanzas et al., 2016), and the effect of weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) that directly affect the efficiency of PV cells (Mekhilef et al., 2012) can be considered differently depending on the selected conversion model. The use of machine learning techniques has significantly improved the forecasting accuracy of solar energy models that use historical data. Because a machine learning model is generally datadependent, various types (e.g., input variables) and resolutions (e.g., time horizons) of data have been tested to assess their performance in predicting the output of interest. Nevertheless, the effects of topographical variations at PV plant sites and temporal variations in meteorological conditions on PV power generation remain poorly understood, particularly when investigating wide areas to find potential sites for solar PV systems."
Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction3,"Many of the previous studies listed in Table 1 focused on generating power predictions for a single PV plant to analyze energy supply and demand. When data-driven approaches are applied for new plants, however, the data from one site might not adequately capture the circumstances at other sites with different geographical and topographical features. For instance, the topographical conditions, which can be extracted from terrain datasets, determine the spatial variations of solar irradiation ( Súri et al., 2005). Particularly in mountainous regions with complex terrains, this issue can be significant when estimating the amount of solar radiation available because of shading effects (Jung et al., 2019). On the other hand, the direct methods presented in Table 1 directly predict PV power at multiple sites distributed across a large area, but the purpose of those studies was mainly to model the temporal relationship between available solar energy (e.g., solar irradiation) and power output, rather than comparing spatial features among PV facilities by relying on available solar irradiation datasets. For example, Hossain et al. (2017) presented forecasting models for three PV plants that were built and individually tested with weather datasets. Datasets with spatial resolutions of 12.5*12.5 km2 and 7*7km2 were used in Wolff et al. (2016) to extract precise topographical features; spatial resolution is important because the necessary features cannot be extracted if the PV system is smaller than a single raster cell on the map."
Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction4,"Although short-term forecasting (e.g., 1 h or one day ahead) is suitable for balancing variations between power supply and demand, long-term forecasting is needed to assess the economic feasibility (e.g., annual revenues) of new PV plants when investigating potential PV sites (Antonanzas et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2002). For example, annual data are often adopted to evaluate suitable PV sites because of the long payback time and maintenance period of a PV facility (Dalton et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2011). However, the performances of the machine learning models in most of the studies in Table 1 were evaluated with short time horizons. Thus, it is questionable whether data with short temporal resolutions can capture monthly or seasonal temporal patterns that can vary nonlinearly by month or season. For instance, Gao et al. (2019) built four individual models for the four seasons, reporting root mean square errors (RMSEs) in predicting PV power 1 h ahead of 5.34%, 9.57%, 13.86%, and 9.26% for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. Abdel-Nasser and Mahmoud (2017) showed that temporal patterns of PV power were more apparent in a monthly resolution than in hourly, daily, or weekly resolutions. Whether temporal patterns of meteorological conditions can be preserved in monthly data and successfully modeled for long-term power prediction remains undiscovered, and it’s an important question when using a single forecasting model with data from multiple PV sites to make predictions about other sites."
Long short-term memory recurrent neural network for modeling temporal patterns in long-term power forecasting for solar PV facilities: Case study of South Korea,Introduction5,"Thererfore, the purpose of this study is to propose and evaluate a machine learningebased forecasting model trained with data from multiple PV plants to predict the monthly PV power generation at new PV sites. Specifically, the network model is built with time series data collected from 164 spatially distributed actual PV plants on a monthly temporal resolution. To acquire the temporal patterns observed in the data from multiple sites, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) layers is adopted to process sequences of monthly data (e.g., monthly solar irradiation) and learn the temporal and topographical variations in solar irradiation and weather conditions. The LSTM unit in the forecasting model is expected to recognize and remember seasonal patterns hidden in the monthly weather and PV capacity datasets. Unlike in previous studiesdin which multiple LSTMbased models were individually built for each facility (e.g., 21 models in Han et al., 2019) or season (e.g., 4 seasonal models in Gao et al., 2019)dthis study uses a single integrated forecasting model that can be applied to PV sites whose data were not used during training. Therefore, the proposed method is intended to improve prediction performance by incorporating seasonal temporal patterns into the modeling to accurately estimate the potential for solar PV power generation at any candidate site."
